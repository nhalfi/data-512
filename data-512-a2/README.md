This repository describes the analysis I conducted for Assignment 2 of DATA 512, where I examined bias in the Wikipedia Talk corpus. This corpus contains data on the scoring of aggression, personal attacks, and toxicity in Wikipedia editor dicussions.

I examined two datasets from this corpus:  
* Aggression dataset (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Aggression/4267550)  
* Personal Attacks dataset (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Personal_Attacks/4054689).

My research questions were as follows:

#### 1. Are non-native English speakers more or less likely to label comments as aggressive than native English speakers?
#### 2. What types of personal attacks are most common, and what kind of words are most often associated with one type vs. another?

Please refer to the Jupyter notebook in this repository for more details on my conclusions.
